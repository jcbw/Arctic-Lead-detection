Sea ice leads are produced from deformational forces, which break apart the ice surface and expose open water areas. Open water leads are the highest regulators of heat in the Arctic during Polar night-time, producing low level cloud layers from vertical heat exchange in the atmosphere. Partially frozen and re-frozen lead areas produce smaller heat exchanges with the absence of a warm water surface. Identifying past and present ice types through machine learning techniques is useful in change detection and climate change studies. This paper uses Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data with a support vector machine classifier to identify leads of open water and thin ice types across the Beaufort Gyre.
